# SolangeOS

SolangeOS is a unified platform for trading, automating, and building on Solana. It simplifies on-chain activity by combining key tools—trading interfaces, strategy builders, and deployment utilities—into a single environment optimized for performance and usability.

Designed for both technical and non-technical users, SolangeOS eliminates the need for fragmented workflows. Whether you're executing trades, deploying smart contracts, or managing assets, everything runs through one clean, purpose-built interface.

## Overview

SolangeOS offers:

- A single dashboard for Solana-native trading, building, and on-chain automation
- Direct integration with major DEXs and protocols including Jupiter, Orca, and Raydium
- A no-code/low-code editor to deploy and manage contracts
- Real-time execution and strategy customization
- Wallet support for Phantom, Backpack, and WalletConnect

Built on Solana’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure, SolangeOS is designed for users who want to move quickly, test ideas, and interact with DeFi without friction.

## Use Cases

- Trade SPL tokens through best-price routing
- Automate portfolio strategies with conditional triggers
- Launch tokens, NFTs, and contracts from pre-built templates
- Build and deploy custom on-chain tools without writing full codebases

## Installation

Install the Solange CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g solange
```

To initialize a new Solange project:

```bash

```

This will scaffold a starter config, connect to Solana, and guide you through deploying or managing on-chain actions.
